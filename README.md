# Hello, World! practice problem solutions

This repository contains solutions to practice problems for LaunchCode's [Hello, World! course][hw-site].

*Note*: Your code will likely vary in small (or sometimes larger) ways from these solutions. That's okay! As long as your logic is comparable to our solutions, you'll know you are on the right track. There is rarely only one correct solution to a programming problem.
